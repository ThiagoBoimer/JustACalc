### Just a simple calculator.

## :information_source: About

So, after a few classes introducing frames, buttons, textfields and all that, my teacher made an example of a calculator. It could do only one operation at a time and well, 
I've got the point, but I wanted it to do a little more.

I know there are a lot of calculators out there way better than mine, BUT I've managed to make one that (compared to my teacher's):

* Uses better OOP, I guess;
* Uses `LayoutManager`, making it easier to add or adjust components;
* Does more than one operation at a time;
* Prioritize operators like `*` such that `1 + 2 * 3` `= 7` and not `= 9`;
* Added tests using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), although I haven't really made any tests yet.

## :bulb: Future updates

* Figure out some tests to do;
* Action the buttons also throught keyboard;
* Add `,` to work with real numbers;
* Add other operators like `log`, `^`, `sqrt`;
* Workout exceptions.

## That's it, [JustACalc-v0](https://github.com/ThiagoBoimer/JustACalc/raw/master/JustACalc-v0.jar)
